Description: |
    The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point
    computations with "correct rounding". The MPFR is efficient and
    also has a well-defined semantics. It copies the good ideas from the
    ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for double-precision floating-point arithmetic
    (53-bit mantissa). MPFR is based on the GMP multiple-precision library.

Requires:
    - gmp >= 4.2.3
    - mpfr1
PkgBR:
    - autoconf
    - libtool
    - mpfr
    - gmp-devel
Configure: configure

      Description: |
          The static libraries, header files and documentation for using the MPFR
          multiple-precision floating-point library in applications.
          
          If you want to develop applications which will use the MPFR library,
          you'll need to install the mpfr-devel package.  You'll also need to
          install the mpfr package.
